# 621. Task Scheduler

## Problem

Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where different letters represent different tasks.Tasks could be done without original order. Each task could be done in one interval. For each interval, CPU could finish one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative cooling interval n that means between two same tasks, there must be at least n intervals that CPU are doing different tasks or just be idle.

You need to return the least number of intervals the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

Example 1:
```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
```

Note:
The number of tasks is in the range [1, 10000].
The integer n is in the range [0, 100].


## Solution

`Greedy` and fill the matrix
```
class Solution:
    def leastInterval(self, tasks, n):
        """
        :type tasks: List[str]
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        @m: number of maximum tasks 出现最多次数tasks的次数
        @n: interval
        make a m x n matrix, let the rest tasks fill the nxm-1 matrix, calculate 
        the rest space in the matrix, then we can calculate the idle
        """
        dict1 = {}
        m = 0
        mt = ""
        sum1 = 0
        for t in tasks:
            sum1+=1
            if t not in dict1:
                dict1[t] = 1
            else:
                dict1[t] += 1
            if dict1[t] > m:
                m = dict1[t]
                mt = t  
        m = m-1
        total = m*n
        for t in dict1:
            if t!= mt:
                total -= min(dict1[t],m)   #如果当前tasks数和m一样，取m-1（削掉最后一行）
        if total<0:
            return sum1
        return total+sum1
```
